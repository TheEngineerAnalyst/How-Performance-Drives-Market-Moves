This file contains the code for a data exploratory analysis project using python that investigated correlations between elements from the financial statements and stock price. The purpose was to attempt to mimic the approach that hedge funds implement to make sustainable profits: a combination of advanced data analytics, economic analysis, and business intuation. The following people were contributors to this project: Mishil Trivedi, Brendan Wilcox, Arnav Sachdeva, Aryan Sehgal, Nilay Jaini, and myself (Rebecca Bubis).
