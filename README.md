# How-Performance-Drives-Market-Moves
This file contains code for an exploratory data analysis project using Python, which investigates correlations between elements of financial statements and stock prices. The project's aim was to replicate the strategies hedge funds use to generate sustainable profits by combining advanced data analytics, economic analysis, and business intuition. It utilized data from both large and small high-performing companies within the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund Admiral Shares (VSMAX) to explore the financial characteristics of these companies.

The following people were contributors to this project: Mishil Trivedi, Brendan Wilcox, and myself (Rebecca Bubis).
